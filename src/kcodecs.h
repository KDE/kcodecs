  @class KCodecs::Decoder kcodecs.h KCodecs

  @brief Stateful CTE decoder class

  Stateful decoder class, modelled after QTextDecoder.

  @section Overview

  KCodecs decoders are designed to be able to process encoded data in
  chunks of arbitrary size and to work with output buffers of also
  arbitrary size. They maintain any state necessary to go on where
  the previous call left off.

  The class consists of only two methods of interest: see decode,
  which decodes an input block and finalize, which flushes any
  remaining data to the output stream.

  Typically, you will create a decoder instance, call decode as
  often as necessary, then call finalize (most often a single
  call suffices, but it might be that during that call the output
  buffer is filled, so you should be prepared to call finalize
  as often as necessary, ie. until it returns @p true).

  @section Return Values

  Both methods return @p true to indicate that they've finished their
  job. For decode, a return value of @p true means that the
  current input block has been finished (@p false most often means
  that the output buffer is full, but that isn't required
  behavior. The decode call is free to return at arbitrary
  times during processing).

  For finalize, a return value of @p true means that all data
  implicitly or explicitly stored in the decoder instance has been
  flushed to the output buffer. A @p false return value should be
  interpreted as "check if the output buffer is full and call me
  again", just as with decode.

  @section Usage Pattern

  Since the decoder maintains state, you can only use it once. After
  a sequence of input blocks has been processed, you finalize
  the output and then delete the decoder instance. If you want to
  process another input block sequence, you create a new instance.

  Typical usage (@p in contains the (base64-encoded) input data),
  taking into account all the conventions detailed above:

  <pre>
  KCodecs::Codec *codec = KCodecs::Codec::codecForName("base64");
  if (!codec) {
      qFatal() << "No codec found for base64!";
  }
  KCodecs::Decoder *dec = codec->makeDecoder();
  Q_ASSERT(dec); // should not happen
  QByteArray out(256); // small buffer is enough ;-)
  QByteArray::Iterator iit = in.begin();
  QByteArray::Iterator oit = out.begin();
  // decode the chunk
  while (!dec->decode(iit, in.end(), oit, out.end()))
    if (oit == out.end()) { // output buffer full, process contents
      do_something_with(out);
      oit = out.begin();
    }
  // repeat while loop for each input block
  // ...
  // finish (flush remaining data from decoder):
  while (!dec->finish(oit, out.end()))
    if (oit == out.end()) { // output buffer full, process contents
      do_something_with(out);
      oit = out.begin();
    }
  // now process last chunk:
  out.resize(oit - out.begin());
  do_something_with(out);
  // _delete_ the decoder, but not the codec:
  delete dec;
  </pre>
